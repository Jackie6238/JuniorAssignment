# Pump Telemetry Monitor

A small C#/.NET application that simulates telemetry from multiple industrial pump devices and detects abnormal operating conditions.

## How to run

Requires the .NET 8 SDK or later.

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/PumpTelemetry.Monitor
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the monitor gracefully.

## How to test

```powershell
dotnet test
```

## Architecture choices

The solution is split into:

- `PumpTelemetry.Core`: telemetry models, simulated device producers, processing pipeline, and alert detection.
- `PumpTelemetry.Monitor`: console entry point that wires devices, pipeline, and console alert output together.
- `PumpTelemetry.Tests`: xUnit tests for threshold, sequence, silence, and concurrent submission behavior.

The console app starts five simulated devices. Each device emits a `TelemetryReading` every 100-500ms with a device id, timestamp, pressure, temperature, and sequence number. The simulator occasionally produces a pressure spike and an out-of-order sequence so the alert paths can be seen during a short run.

## Concurrency approach

The processing pipeline uses a bounded `Channel<TelemetryReading>` as an asynchronous fan-in queue. Multiple device tasks can publish concurrently, and the channel capacity provides backpressure if producers outpace alert processing for long enough. A single reader consumes the channel so per-device sequence checks are deterministic and based on channel arrival order.

Shutdown is idempotent: completing the channel writer and cancelling the silent-device monitor is safe to request more than once. Queued readings drain before shutdown completes. The silent-device monitor runs on a `PeriodicTimer` and is cancelled during shutdown.

## Alerts

The pipeline emits console alerts for:

- pressure above the configured threshold,
- out-of-order sequence numbers,
- devices silent for more than 5 seconds.

Silent-device detection starts tracking a device after its first reading, because the monitor has no external device registry in this small assignment.
